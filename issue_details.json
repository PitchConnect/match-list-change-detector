{"body":"# Implement Comprehensive Code Quality System\n\n## Overview\nEstablish a robust code quality system early in the project to prevent technical debt and ensure maintainability. This implementation should follow an iterative approach, gradually introducing and enforcing standards to avoid overwhelming changes.\n\n## Goals\n- Improve code consistency and readability\n- Catch bugs and issues early\n- Ensure security best practices\n- Prepare codebase for CI/CD implementation\n- Make the repository more maintainable for contributors\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n**Important**: Follow an iterative approach where each step includes:\n1. Add a new quality check\n2. Update existing code to pass the check\n3. Commit changes\n4. Move to the next check\n\nThis gradual approach prevents overwhelming changes and ensures CI won't fail when implemented.\n\n## Detailed Tasks\n\n### Phase 1: Basic Formatting and Linting\n- [ ] Set up Black for code formatting\n  - Configure with line length of 100\n  - Add to pre-commit hooks\n  - Format existing codebase\n- [ ] Configure isort for import sorting\n  - Ensure compatibility with Black (use `profile=black` setting)\n  - Sort imports in existing files\n- [ ] Enhance flake8 configuration\n  - Update existing setup.cfg\n  - Explicitly ignore rules that conflict with Black (E203, W503)\n  - **Skip enforcement of lazy string interpolation** for readability\n  - **Skip rules about colons and spaces** that conflict with Black\n\n### Phase 2: Static Analysis\n- [ ] Implement mypy for type checking\n  - Start with basic configuration\n  - Gradually increase strictness\n  - Add type annotations to core functions first\n- [ ] Add pylint or ruff for deeper linting\n  - Begin with permissive settings\n  - Focus on catching bugs rather than style issues\n  - Gradually increase strictness as codebase improves\n- [ ] Implement bandit for security scanning\n  - Focus on high-severity issues first\n  - Document any necessary exceptions\n\n### Phase 3: Testing Infrastructure\n- [ ] Enhance pytest configuration\n  - Add pytest-cov for coverage reporting\n  - Set minimum coverage thresholds (start low, increase over time)\n  - Configure pytest-xdist for parallel testing\n- [ ] Implement property-based testing with hypothesis\n  - Start with simple properties\n  - Focus on core business logic\n- [ ] Add integration tests\n  - Test full application flow\n  - Mock external dependencies\n\n### Phase 4: Documentation and Dependency Management\n- [ ] Set up documentation generation\n  - Configure Sphinx or pdoc\n  - Add docstring requirements to pre-commit\n- [ ] Implement dependency management\n  - Pin dependencies with pip-tools\n  - Add safety for vulnerability scanning\n  - Check license compliance\n\n### Phase 5: Pre-commit and CI Integration\n- [ ] Configure comprehensive pre-commit hooks\n  - Combine all previous tools\n  - Ensure fast execution\n- [ ] Prepare CI configuration\n  - Create matrix for different Python versions\n  - Set up caching for faster runs\n  - Configure appropriate failure conditions\n\n## Specific Configuration Recommendations\n\n### Black Configuration\n```toml\n# pyproject.toml\n[tool.black]\nline-length = 100\ntarget-version = ['py39']\ninclude = '\\.pyi?$'\n```\n\n### isort Configuration\n```toml\n# pyproject.toml\n[tool.isort]\nprofile = \"black\"\nline_length = 100\n```\n\n### flake8 Configuration\n```ini\n# setup.cfg\n[flake8]\nmax-line-length = 100\nextend-ignore = E203, W503\n# E203: whitespace before ':' (conflicts with Black)\n# W503: line break before binary operator (conflicts with Black)\nper-file-ignores =\n    # Allow print statements in scripts\n    scripts/*.py: T201\n```\n\n### mypy Configuration\n```toml\n# pyproject.toml\n[tool.mypy]\npython_version = \"3.9\"\nwarn_return_any = true\nwarn_unused_configs = true\ndisallow_untyped_defs = false  # Start with False, change to True later\ndisallow_incomplete_defs = false  # Start with False, change to True later\n```\n\n### Pre-commit Configuration\n```yaml\n# .pre-commit-config.yaml\nrepos:\n-   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n    rev: v4.4.0\n    hooks:\n    -   id: trailing-whitespace\n    -   id: end-of-file-fixer\n    -   id: check-yaml\n    -   id: check-added-large-files\n\n-   repo: https://github.com/psf/black\n    rev: 23.3.0\n    hooks:\n    -   id: black\n\n-   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/isort\n    rev: 5.12.0\n    hooks:\n    -   id: isort\n\n-   repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8\n    rev: 6.0.0\n    hooks:\n    -   id: flake8\n        additional_dependencies: [flake8-docstrings]\n```\n\n## Notes for Implementation\n- Start with the most critical tools first (Black, isort, flake8)\n- Make one change at a time and ensure all tests pass before moving on\n- Document any exceptions or special cases\n- Consider the impact on developer experience\n- Balance strictness with practicality\n- Maintain a list of \"technical debt\" items to address later\n\n## Success Criteria\n- All code passes the configured checks\n- Pre-commit hooks run successfully\n- Documentation is generated correctly\n- Test coverage meets the defined thresholds\n- The system is ready for CI/CD implementation\n","labels":[{"id":"LA_kwDOOUIkLc8AAAAB9PSJ2g","name":"enhancement","description":"New feature or request","color":"a2eeef"},{"id":"LA_kwDOOUIkLc8AAAAB9PSJ4Q","name":"good first issue","description":"Good for newcomers","color":"7057ff"}],"title":"Implement Comprehensive Code Quality System"}
