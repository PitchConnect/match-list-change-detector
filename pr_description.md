# Enhance Security Checks and Fix Security Vulnerabilities

This PR addresses issue #4 by implementing comprehensive security enhancements to the codebase.

## Changes

### Security Improvements
- Added `get_executable_path()` function to find absolute paths for executables
- Added `validate_file_path()` function to prevent directory traversal attacks
- Implemented secure credential handling with `mask_sensitive_data()`
- Added HTTPS support for health server
- Added security headers to HTTP responses
- Implemented rate limiting for API requests
- Updated security configurations in CI/CD pipeline
- Added tests for security features

### Configuration Updates
- Updated `.github/workflows/security.yml` to remove skipped security checks
- Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to remove bandit from the SKIP list
- Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to remove skipped security checks

## Testing

All security checks now pass successfully:
- Bandit security scanner reports no issues
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks pass
- Code quality checks (flake8, mypy) pass

## Documentation

- Added a new "Security" section to the README.md file
- Added docstrings for all new functions and methods

## Notes

The docstring formatting issues (pydocstyle) are part of issue #3 and will be addressed separately.

Closes #4
